//! # lnx Datacake
//! Easy to use tooling for building eventually consistent distributed data systems in Rust.
//!
//! > "Oh consistency where art thou?" - CF.
//!
//! ### Features âœ¨
//! - **Simple** setup, a cluster can be setup and ready to use with one trait.
//! - Adjustable consistency levels when mutating state.
//! - Data center aware replication prioritisation.
//! - Pre-built test suite for `Storage` trait implementations to ensure correct functionality.
//!
//! ### The packages
//! Datacake provides several utility libraries as well as some pre-made data store handlers:
//!
//! - `datacake-crdt` - A CRDT implementation based on a hybrid logical clock (HLC)
//!   provided in the form of the `HLCTimestamp`.
//! - `datacake-node` - A cluster membership system and managed RPC built on top of chitchat.
//! - `datacake-eventual-consistency` - Built on top of `datacake-crdt`, a batteries included framework
//!   for building eventually consistent, replicated systems where you only need to implement a basic
//!   storage trait.
//! - `datacake-sqlite` - A pre-built and tested implementation of the datacake `Storage` trait built
//!   upon SQLite.
//! - `datacake-rpc` - A fast, zero-copy RCP framework with a familiar actor-like feel to it.
//!
//! ### Examples
//! Check out some pre-built apps we have in the
//! [example folder](https://github.com/lnx-search/datacake/tree/main/examples)
//!
//! You can also look at some heavier integration tests
//! [here](https://github.com/lnx-search/datacake/tree/main/datacake-eventual-consistency/tests)
//!
//! #### Single Node Cluster
//! Here's an example of a basic cluster with one node that runs on your local network, it uses almost all of the packages
//! including:
//!
//! - `datacake-node` for the core node membership.
//! - `datacake-crdt` for the HLCTimestamp and CRDT implementations
//! - `datacake-eventually-consistency` for the eventually consistent replication of state.
//! - `datacake-rpc` bundled up with everything for managing all the cluster RPC.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::net::SocketAddr;
//! use datacake::node::{Consistency, ConnectionConfig, DCAwareSelector, DatacakeNodeBuilder};
//! use datacake::eventual_consistency::test_utils::MemStore;
//! use datacake::eventual_consistency::EventuallyConsistentStoreExtension;
//!
//! async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//!     let addr = "127.0.0.1:8080".parse::<SocketAddr>().unwrap();
//!     let connection_cfg = ConnectionConfig::new(addr, addr, Vec::<String>::new());
//!     let node = DatacakeNodeBuilder::<DCAwareSelector>::new(1, connection_cfg)
//!         .connect()
//!         .await
//!         .expect("Connect node.");
//!
//!     let store = node
//!         .add_extension(EventuallyConsistentStoreExtension::new(MemStore::default()))
//!         .await
//!         .expect("Create store.");
//!
//!     let handle = store.handle();
//!
//!     handle
//!         .put(
//!             "my-keyspace",
//!             1,
//!             b"Hello, world! From keyspace 1.".to_vec(),
//!             Consistency::All,
//!         )
//!         .await
//!         .expect("Put doc.");
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Why does Datacake exist?
//!
//! Datacake is the result of my attempts at bringing high-availability to [lnx](https://github.com/lnx-search/lnx)
//! unlike languages like Erlang or Go, Rust currently has a fairly young ecosystem around distributed
//! systems. This makes it very hard to build a replicated system in Rust without implementing a lot of things
//! from scratch and without a lot of research into the area to begin with.
//!
//! Currently, the main algorithms available in Rust is [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) which is replication via
//! consensus, overall it is a very good algorithm, and it's a very simple to understand algorithm however,
//! I'm not currently satisfied that the current implementations are stable enough or are maintained in order to
//! choose it. (Also for lnx's particular use case leader-less eventual consistency was more preferable.)
//!
//! Because of the above, I built Datacake with the aim of building a reliable, well tested, eventual consistent system
//! akin to how Cassandra or more specifically how ScyllaDB behave with eventual consistent replication, but with a few
//! core differences:
//!
//! - Datacake does not require an external source or read repair to clear tombstones.
//! - The underlying CRDTs which are what actually power Datacake are kept purely in memory.
//! - Partitioning and sharding is not (currently) supported.
//!
//! It's worth noting that Datacake itself does not implement the consensus and membership algorithms from scratch, instead
//! we use [chitchat](https://github.com/quickwit-oss/chitchat) developed by [Quickwit](https://quickwit.io/) which is an
//! implementation of the scuttlebutt algorithm.

//! ### Contributing
//! Contributions are always welcome, although please open an issue for an idea about extending the main cluster system
//! if you wish to extend or modify it heavily as something's are not always as simple as they seem.
//!
//! #### What sort of things could I contribute?
//! ðŸ§ª Tests! ðŸ§ª Tests! ðŸ§ª Tests! Joking aside testing is probably the most important part of the system, extending these
//! tests in any way you might think of, big or small is a huge help :)
//!
//! ### Future Ideas
//! - Multi-raft framework?
//! - CASPaxos???
//! - More storage implementations?
